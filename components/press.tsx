              We are very pleased to finally announce the official registration and launch of the OVOS Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing open-source voice assistant technology. This milestone comes after overcoming numerous challenges posed by the stricter regulatory landscape introduced within the Netherlands for foundations after the worldwide Corona era. Although the foundation was established in August 2024, it took another half year to arrange all other legal obligations and secure a worldwide accessible bank account under non-profit regulations. Despite these challenges, the newly established Foundation is committed to advancing the development and deployment of open-source voice operating systems while ensuring privacy, security, and user-centric innovation.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                In a world where proprietary voice assistants dominate the market, we aim to offer a compelling alternative that prioritizes user privacy, transparency, and community collaboration. Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations to create, innovate, and use voice assistant technology without compromising their privacy or control over their data.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Proprietary voice assistants from major tech companies often come with a range of privacy concerns. These include extensive data collection, behavioral profiling, and limited user control over personal information. The OpenVoiceOS project addresses these issues by providing an open-source platform where all aspects of the voice assistant can be audited, customized, and improved by the community. We already collaborate with a diverse range of contributors to create an accessible and inclusive platform that supports a wide range of languages and abilities. By transparency and ethical practices, we create and foster a culture of privacy and user control to build trust and confidence in the tech industry which enables individuals to benefit from the convenience and innovation of voice technology.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
                The OVOS Foundation was established not only to support and advance our platform but also to safeguard it from the vulnerabilities that led to the unfortunate fate of the Mycroft project. Despite the groundbreaking work done by Mycroft A.I., the company faced bankruptcy, jeopardizing the continuity and accessibility of its open-source voice assistant technology. To ensure that OpenVoiceOS does not encounter a similar fate, the Foundation provides a stable and sustainable structure for the project's long-term success. By operating as a non-profit, we can focus on our mission without the pressures that often accompany for-profit enterprises.

              The establishment of the OVOS Foundation is just the beginning. We are excited about the future and the possibilities that lie ahead. Together, we can build a voice assistant platform that respects user privacy, fosters innovation, and empowers everyone to take control of their technology. In the second half of last year, we launched ovos-core 0.0.8. This was the very first stable release under the OpenVoiceOS project umbrella, maintaining Mycroft backwards compatibility while fully integrating all OVOS plugins and skills across most components.

              In the meantime, we have adopted semantic version control, allowing us to release future versions as rolling releases. For the upcoming releases, we have some exciting features being developed and mostly already in progress. Stay tuned for updates and announcements as we embark on this journey.
