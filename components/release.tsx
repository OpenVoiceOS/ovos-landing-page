                                We're excited to announce that OVOS version 0.0.8 is now available as a pre-release beta! This version marks a significant milestone for OVOS: it's not only our final release that maintains Mycroft backwards compatibility but also our first to fully integrate OVOS plugins across most components. This step forward reflects our commitment to enhancing user experience and fostering innovation within our community.
                            </p>
                            <h3 className="mt-4 font-bold">Participate in our pre-release beta</h3>
                            <p>
                                We invite all community members to install and test the 0.0.8 pre-release beta. Your feedback is invaluable, especially during the next two weeks, as we focus on addressing any bugs you encounter. This beta testing period is crucial for ensuring a stable and polished 0.0.8 release. Although 0.0.8 alphas have been stable for months, your insights during this formal QA process will help us make the final release the best it can be.
                            </p>
                            <h3 className="mt-4 font-bold">How to upgrade</h3>
                            <p>
                                RaspOVOS users should use @builderjer's upgrade script to use with existing installations. They may also re-flash with the testing version of RaspOVOS.<br />
                                ovos-docker users should continue to use development containers - they will remain stable and receive bugfixes during the testing period.<br />
                                ovos-installer users can git pull to get the latest installer code, then re-run the installer. This will bring you to the latest pre-release version.
