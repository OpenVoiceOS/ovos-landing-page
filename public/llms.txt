# OpenVoiceOS (OVOS)

> A community-driven, open-source, privacy-focused voice AI platform for creating custom voice-controlled interfaces.

## Summary
OpenVoiceOS is a Linux-based operating system and framework for building custom voice assistants. It allows for granular control over privacy, modularity, and hardware. It started as a fork of Mycroft AI, designed to run on embedded devices (Raspberry Pi), desktops, and servers.

## Architecture Overview
- **Messagebus (IPC):** A core feature connecting all services. It uses a **websocket** protocol (default port 8181) and is **restricted to localhost** by default for security. All data is passed as JSON messages.
- **Core:** The central `ovos-core` service manages skill loading and NLP.
- **Audio:** The `ovos-audio` service handles all audio output.
- **Listener:** The `ovos-dinkum-listener` service handles all audio input.
- **Plugins (Modular System):** OVOS is built entirely around plugins, managed by `ovos-plugin-manager`. Key categories include **STT, TTS, Wake Word (WW), Audio Backend, PHAL (Hardware), VAD and Intent Parsers**.
- **Agents/Personas:** The platform supports multiple "Personas" allowing different behavior profiles to run concurrently. [See Personas Documentation](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/150-personas/) for details.
- **Skills:** Python-based modules (apps) that implement specific functionality and listen for intent messages.
